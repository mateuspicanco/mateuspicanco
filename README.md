# Hello, I'm Mateus and welcome to my github profile

I am a data scientist from Manaus currently living in São Paulo, Brazil. I graduated from Brown University in Electrical Engineering (Multimedia Signal Processing) in 2018, and since then have been developing my skills in the field of data science and machine learning and working on projects in the field at big Brazilian companies, such as Itaú Unibanco and Telefonica (Vivo).

I am very passionated about the application of ML in information retrieval, data mining and natural language processing, especially in the context of hard-to-process entities such as historical documents and music. I believe AI has a potential for helping humanity preserve its cultural history.

I also like to write about a variety of topics related to the data science, including Natural Language Processing and Elasticsearch.
