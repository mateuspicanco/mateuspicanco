Hi folks! Welcome to my Github profile. Here you will find the source code and documentation for my projects. If you are interested in talking more about them, feel free to hit me up on LinkedIn! (you can find it at the badge up there :point_up:).

So, if you got here, here are some facts about me:

- :school: I have a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering from [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/);
- :bank: I am currently a Data Scientist at [BTG Pactual](https://www.linkedin.com/company/btgpactual/mycompany/), working with CRM;
- :rocket: Recently I have been studying more about Bayesian Inference;
- :computer: I am working on projects related to Geospatial and Socioeconomic data in the Real State industry;

**An extra fact for those who stayed**: I play 14 different musical instruments and have an [album on spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7kilyBrsKL8lSoW5tU9s5Y).

## Some principles behind my work

> **Being clever is awesome, but making everyone in the room understand what is being said is much better.**;

> **Code is written by and made for humans. Context and history matters are very important.**;

> **Technology does not mean anything without users. People always come first.**;
