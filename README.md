# Mateus PicanÃ§o

Hi everyone, here is Mateus, welcome to my Github Profile!

I'm an experienced Data Scientist who loves to share knowledge and the things I've been curious about. Sometimes I write on my [Medium blog](https://mateuspicanco.medium.com/) and on my portuguese-only blog [Papo de Dados](https://papodedados.com/). 

A few interesting things about me:
- :school: I have a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering from [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/), and I studied a lot about Digital Signal Processing in college;
- :computer: I am a Data Scientist at @microsoft, working on Microsoft Stream, the company's Enterprise video platform;
- :rocket: Recently I have been studying more about the applications of Unsupervised Learning to Causal Inference and Experimentation

## Let me tell you about some of my work principles:

> Being **clever** is being able to make **everyone** in a room can **understand you**. Let's just say I'm not a fan of one-liners.

> **People** first, **technology second**, **never** the opposite.
