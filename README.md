# Mateus PicanÃ§o

Hi everyone, here is Mateus, welcome to my Github Profile!

I'm an experienced Data Scientist who loves to share knowledge and the things I've been curious about. Sometimes I write on my [Medium blog](https://mateuspicanco.medium.com/) and on my portuguese-only blog [Papo de Dados](https://papodedados.com/). 

A few interesting things about me:
- :school: I have a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering from [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/);
- :computer: I am currently a Data Scientist at @microsoft, working on Content Platforms and Audio/Video User behavior;
- :rocket: Recently I have been studying more about the applications of Unsupervised Learning to Causal Inference and Experimentation

## Here are my work principles are:

> **Being clever is being able to make everyone in a room understand you**
> **People first, technology second. Never the opposite**
