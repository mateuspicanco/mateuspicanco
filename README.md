# Hi, I'm Mateus and welcome to github

I am a data scientist from Manaus, Brazil living in SÃ£o Paulo. I graduated from Brown University in Electrical Engineering (Multimedia Signal Processing) in 2018, and since then have been developing my data science skills.

I am passionate about the application of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence to information retrieval, data mining and natural language.

I write about a variety of topics related to the data science field, including Natural Language Processing and Elasticsearch.
