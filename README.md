Hi folks! Welcome to my Github Profile.

I'm Mateus, a Data Scientist and Content Creator based in São Paulo, Brazil. 

I create content about Data Science, Product Analytics and Experimentation in several platforms. You can find me on [Medium](https://mateuspicanco.medium.com/) and on [Papo de Dados](https://papodedados.com/), my blog and youtube channel.

- :school: I have a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering from [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/);
- :bank: I am currently a Data Scientist at @microsoft, working on Content Platforms and Audio/Video User behavior;
- :rocket: Recently I have been studying more about Causal Inference and Unsupervised Learning;
- :computer: I am working on projects related to Product Analytics and Uplift modelling;

**An extra fact for those who stayed**: I play 14 different musical instruments and have an [album on spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7kilyBrsKL8lSoW5tU9s5Y).

## My main work principles are?

> **Being clever is awesome, but making everyone in the room understand what is being said is much better.**

> **Code is written by and made for humans. Context and history matter.**

> **Technology does not mean anything without its users. People always come first.**
