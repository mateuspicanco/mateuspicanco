# Mateus PicanÃ§o

I'm an experienced Data Scientist who loves to share knowledge and the things I've been curious about. Sometimes I write on my [Medium blog](https://mateuspicanco.medium.com/) and on my portuguese-only blog [Papo de Dados](https://papodedados.com/). 

A few interesting things about me:
- :school: I have a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering from [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/), and I studied a lot about Digital Signal Processing in college;
- :computer: I am a Data Scientist at @microsoft, working on Microsoft Stream, the M365's Enterprise and Education video platform;
- :rocket: I am focusing on Causal Inference and Unsupervised Learning;

## Let me tell you about some of my work principles:

> Being **clever** is being able to make **everyone** in a room can **understand you**. 

> **People** first, **technology second**, **never** the other way around.
