# Hi folks, I'm Mateus, a Data Scientist from Brazil.

I graduated from Brown University in Electrical Engineering (Multimedia Signal Processing) in 2018, and since then have been developing my skills in the field of data science and machine learning and working on projects in the field at big Brazilian companies, such as *Ita√∫ Unibanco* and *Telefonica (Vivo)* and currently in *BTG Pactual*, Latin America's largest Investment Bank.

I am very passionate about **Data Products** and leveraging Machine Learning and predictive technologies to improve people's daily experiences. A frustrated musician, I am particularly fond of applications of Artificial Intelligence to the context of Natural Language Processing and Audio, and making useful products out of these fields. 

Below are some of the my work principles I like to emphasize (which you might see here and there in my code and in the things I write):

1. Being clever is awesome, but being intelligible and accessible is even better;
2. Code is written by and made for humans. Context and history matters;
3. No technology project is done in a vacuum and all should strive to be human-centric;
