# Hello, I'm Mateus and welcome to my github profile

I am a data scientist from Manaus living in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. I graduated from Brown University in Electrical Engineering (Multimedia Signal Processing) in 2018, and since then have been developing my skills in the field of data science and machine learning..

I am very passionated about the application of ML and Artificial Intelligence in general to information retrieval, data mining and natural language, especially when that includes historical documents and music. I believe AI has a potential for helping humanity preserve its cultural history.

I write about a variety of topics related to the data science and history, including Natural Language Processing and Elasticsearch.
